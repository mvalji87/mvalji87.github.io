								<p>I am a thorough communicator and work well as part of a team in addition to my ability for self-direction.</p>
								<p>Currently, I am pursuing a career path as a back-end developer. This will allow me the opportunity to hone my skills with experience. And allow me to have exposure to different avenues within the computer science umbrella. When I first got into this field of study I was interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. When first working with the code necessary to accomplish a basic task like a game bot or something of that nature. A thrill of excitement does occur. That can be sad with most coding projects, you build something and it starts working before your eyes. With AI it's interesting to see that once you've built it becomes nearly autonomous, give it a task and it will fulfill it and you get to watch the show. Though with further examination my computer skills are not there yet to produce anything of significance. With time and patience, I am sure this will change.

								<p>So far I have worked on a few projects with my course work. </p>
								<p>I plan on haveing them Show cased below</p>
								<p>I have good hands on programming languages like C, C++, Java and Assembly.</p>

								<p>I am up to date on most programming languages and have a history of efficient data entry skills.</p>
								<p> I am incredibly organized and very detail oriented; 
									I rarely make errors and know what even a small mistake can mean to a project.</p>
								<p>Throughout the computer science program, I've been introduced to several strategies and skills that will assist me and for their projects. Whether it's finding a specific purpose for a particular language or how to integrate it within a project to suit a need. As of now, I don't think I have enough familiarity with the concepts that have been introduced to me to make anything significantly impressive. Although with practice and experience, I'm sure I can hone my skills to do so. it is within my nature to believe that all that I do not know or do not have a passing familiarity with is of the greatest value, for it acquires that greater learning is needed to master set skill. What I found so far to be increasingly important are data structures. How to properly import data allow the buffer to hold the data and retrieve it in the most efficient way possible. At the end of the day, every project that has ever performed is responsible for holding and producing data. Even if we were simply to analyze the data in question storage must take place.
